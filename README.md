What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In Project One, I analyzed the run-time and memory usage of different data structures (vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees) for organizing and accessing course data. In Project Two, I implemented sorting algorithms (selection sort and quicksort) to arrange course information in alphanumeric order and used a binary search tree to store and print course listings efficiently.

How did you approach the problem?
I began each project by understanding the requirements and then identifying the most appropriate data structures and algorithms based on their time and space complexity. I chose structures like vectors for sequential access and binary search trees for ordered retrieval. Understanding how each structure works and where it excels helped me make informed design choices.

How did you overcome any roadblocks?
Whenever I faced challenges—like sorting bugs or issues loading data from CSV files—I used debugging techniques and reviewed documentation. I also leaned on pseudocode to map out logic before implementing it in C++. Breaking problems into smaller steps helped me resolve issues more efficiently.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
These projects reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structures early in the design phase. I learned how these choices can drastically affect the performance of a program. It also improved my ability to think algorithmically and write code that meets both functional and performance goals.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I paid special attention to naming conventions, modular design, and code comments. I also wrote helper functions and avoided hardcoding values, which made my programs easier to test, update, and reuse. These habits are helping me become a more professional and thoughtful developer.
